# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM

This project implements a **Stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model** to predict and forecast stock prices.  
LSTMs are highly effective for time-series data as they capture sequential dependencies, making them suitable for financial market predictions.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocessing of historical stock price data (cleaning, scaling, splitting).
- Stacked LSTM architecture for robust sequence learning.
- Training and evaluation with visualization of actual vs. predicted prices.
- Forecasting for future stock market trends.
